STATUS : STILL IN PROGRESS

# my_guy
In Uganda when you need something done, it's all about word of month. But that doesn't mean you will always receive the best service from your friend recommendations.

My guys looks at making it easy to find the right person or service through friends. With my guy friends will share their experiences with your recommendations.

How will my guy be different ?
    My guy will allocate each friend rating power based on their recommendation's performance.
